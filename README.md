# Model repository for BioImage.io


## Models

A list of models can be found [here](./src/manifest.model.yaml).

## How to contribute new models?

BioImage.io is a static website, it reads a manifest file from Github repo and render the page in users' browser. Therefore contributing models to the repository is as easy as adding meta information of your models to the manifest file.

Please follow the following steps:

 1. Fork this repo
 1. Add your models to the `src/manifest.model.yaml` file
 1. Run `python src/compile_model_manifest.py` to generate a new `manifest.model.json` with your models
 1. Commit your changes and push to your Github repo.
 1. You can preview it constructing an URL which makes BioImage.io render the page with the manifest file in your repo. The URL format is: https://bioimage.io?repo=YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO, for example: https://bioimage.io?repo=oeway/models will point to the model manifest hosted on https://github.com/oeway/models.
 1. If you are satisfied with the result above, you can send us a Pull Request, and we will review it before it get merged.

 ## How to build BioEngine Apps?
 
 Each model in the BioImage model zoo can associated with a list of applications which you can run directly in website. We use BioEngine, a tailored version of [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io) to run these applications. Therefore, you can basically run ImJoy plugins with the BioEngine specific api. By default it loads also a [Jupyter Engine](https://github.com/imjoy-team/jupyter-engine-manager) which uses free computational resources on MyBinder.org, so you can also run small models in Python. 

Since BioEngine is designed for running model specific ImJoy plugins, it needs to define either `runOneModel()` and/or `runManyModels()` function in the plugin api. Plus, you need also a `testModel` function which will be used to run tests in a CI environment. For example, the following python plugin would treat as a qualified BioEngine App:

```
from imjoy import api

class ImJoyPlugin():
    def setup(self):
        pass

    def run(self, ctx):
        pass

    def runOneModel(self, model_info):
        # run the model
        pass

    def runManyModels(self, model_info_list):
        # filter the model list and run them
        pass
    
    def testModel(self):
        # run tests for the model
        pass

api.export(ImJoyPlugin())
```

Note, this means your plugin would contain 4~5 functions including `setup` and `run` which is required for ImJoy.

You don't need to return any value after execution. In case of error, you can just throw or raise the error.

You can do the debugging inside [ImJoy](https://imjoy.io), for more information, please consult https://imjoy.io/docs.

To test with the BioEngine, you can go to https://bioimage.io, on the menu located in the top-right corner, you can load a local ImJoy plugin file to run it with the BioEngine. One additional feature is that the BioEngine will keep track of the local file, if you made new changes with your code editor (e.g. vim, vscode) the engine will try to reload the plugin file. 

## How to submit BioEngine Apps to the website.

You can submit your BioEngine App by changing the same file named `src/manifest.model.yaml` as for contributing models.

Here are the steps:
 1. Once the BioEngine App is ready, you can then push it to your Github repo and get a `raw` URL for the file.
 1. Define a key in the `applications` section in `src/manifest.model.yaml`, and set the value as the `raw` URL to the BioEngine app file.
 1. For all the models which your app can digest, you can add your app key to the `applications` field of the model.
 1. The procedure later are the same as contributing models, you can basically: run `python src/compile_model_manifest.py` to generate a new `manifest.model.json`, commit and push to your Github repo, preview it on BioImage.io with https://bioimage.io?repo=YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO and optionally send us a Pull Request.
